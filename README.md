  ## Description
  This application is a back-end system for an online, ecommerce site. It allows an internet retail shop to track items via category, product, and tag tables. This ecommerce backend links MySQL database with api routes to collect user information, as well as store product and tag related information.

  The models in this project define the MySQL tables and their relationships to one another, while the routes determine what information is displayed, stored, updated, and deleted.

Here is a walkthrough video of my application: "https://www.loom.com/share/31fa9b97db9a44ee8662a4830a4272c1"
